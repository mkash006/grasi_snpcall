# GRAS-Di SNP Calling Pipeline

This repository contains a pipeline for SNP discovery from GRAS-Di (Genotyping by Random Amplicon Sequencing‚ÄìDirect) sequencing data using a combination of **Snakemake** and **shell scripts**. It is tailored for use on an HPC cluster with SLURM and follows **GATK Best Practices** for variant calling.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** All steps assume input files have already been **trimmed to remove adapter contamination**. Raw FASTQ files must be pre-processed using tools such as **Trimmomatic** or **fastp** prior to running this pipeline.

## üîß Pipeline Overview

### üìÇ Snakefile: Per-sample GVCF Calling
The `Snakefile` performs **per-sample variant calling** and generates **GVCF files** via GATK HaplotypeCaller. Key steps include:

1. **Reference Indexing**
2. **Alignment to Reference** (BWA-MEM)
3. **BAM Sorting & Marking Duplicates**
4. **Read Group Assignment**
5. **GATK HaplotypeCaller** in GVCF mode

All outputs are organized in `results/`, and logs are saved in the `logs/` directory.

### üß™ Separate `.sh` Scripts: Joint Genotyping & SNP Filtering
The shell scripts (`.sh` files) are used for **joint SNP calling and post-processing**, including:

- **GATK GenotypeGVCFs**
- **VCF filtering**
- **Chromosome-based selection**
- **Custom filters and VCF manipulation***

These steps are separated intentionally because they often require **manual decisions**, such as:
- Selecting scaffolds or chromosomes of interest
- Adjusting filtering thresholds interactively

## üíª Requirements

- Snakemake
- BWA
- SAMtools
- GATK 4.x
- Python 3
- SLURM (for HPC execution)

Optional tools:
- Trimmomatic or fastp (for trimming before this pipeline)
- bcftools, plink (for downstream filtering)

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

1. Make sure all FASTQ files in `data/` are **adapter-trimmed**.
2. Update the path to your reference genome in the `Snakefile`.
3. Run the Snakemake pipeline:

```bash
snakemake --jobs 100 --cluster "sbatch --cpus-per-task={threads} --mem={resources.mem_mb} --time=24:00:00" --use-conda
